This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++.

Description
The program allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 board. Players take turns placing their markers ('X' or 'O') on the board until one of them wins by getting three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the board is filled with no winner resulting in a tie.
